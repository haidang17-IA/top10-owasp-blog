## What is Broken Authentication?



Authentication is the act of validating the user's credentials before granting him/her access to a certain resource. It's the forefront defense layer that is necessary to control access to critical resources and applications that are only intended for a select few authorized users (for example, applications intended for development purposes).



If authentication was not present, it would leave the critical resources (often with elevated privileges) exposed to anyone on the internet, including unauthenticated and unauthorized users. It ranks high on the \[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10) because of its impact and frequency.



<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>



A simple authentication process often revolves around the validation of a supplied set of user credentials (email and password). However, various other authentication mechanisms are being applied today to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing controlled resources. And when this authentication method is incorrectly configured, it can open a new attack vector.



Applications vulnerable to broken authentication vulnerabilities fail to validate the user's access and as a result, expose the protected application.



## How Do Authentication Vulnerabilities Emerge?



Authentication vulnerabilities primarily stem from three causes: poor security design, flawed programming logic, and insecure user practices. These weaknesses allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks or bypass authentication mechanisms entirely.



## 6 Most Common Authentication Vulnerabilities



Authentication vulnerabilities, if not properly controlled, can damage not just a company’s security but its reputation as well.



Here are 6 of the most common authentication-based vulnerabilities to watch out for:



### 1. Flawed Brute-Force Protection



A brute-force attack, such as a dictionary attack, is an attempt to gain illegal access to a system or user’s account by entering large numbers of randomly generated or pregenerated combinations of usernames and passwords until they find one that works.



If there’s a flawed brute-force protection system such as a flaw in the authentication logic, firewall, or secure shell (SSH) protocol, attackers can hijack login credentials and processes, compromising the security of user credentials.



### 2. Username Enumeration



It can make an attacker’s life easier by lowering the cost for other attacks, such as brute-force attacks or weak credential checks.



This process of username enumeration confirms whether or not a username is valid. For example:



<div style="text-align: center;">

&nbsp; <img src="/top10-owasp-blog/assets/images/2u.png" alt=" " style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

</div>



In this case, the username is correct but the password isn’t.



<div style="text-align: center;">

&nbsp; <img src="/top10-owasp-blog/assets/images/2u2.png" alt=" " style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

</div>



Here, the username is invalid.  

The problem with username enumeration is that attackers can tell what usernames are valid. Then, they can try to hack valid user accounts using brute-force techniques without wasting their time and money testing a multitude of invalid account names.



### 3. Staying Logged In



A "Remember me" or "Keep me logged in" checkbox beneath a login form makes it super easy to stay logged in after closing a session. It generates a cookie that lets you skip the process of logging in.



<div style="text-align: center;">

&nbsp; <img src="/top10-owasp-blog/assets/images/3s.png" alt=" " style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

</div>



They can use malicious techniques like brute-force attacks to predict cookies, and cross-site scripting (XSS) to hack user accounts by allowing a malicious server to make use of a legitimate cookie.



### 4. Unsecure Password Change and Recovery



Sometimes, users forget or just want to change their passwords and click the "Forgot password" or "Lost your password" links.



<div style="text-align: center;">

&nbsp; <img src="/top10-owasp-blog/assets/images/4u.png" alt=" " style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

</div>



The password reset process poses an authentication vulnerability if an application uses a weak password recovery mechanism such as easy security questions, no CAPTCHAs, or password reset e-mails with overly long or no timeouts.



If the password recovery functionality is flawed, attackers can potentially use brute-force techniques or access to other compromised accounts to gain access to user accounts.



### 5. Flawed Two-Factor Authentication



While two-factor authentication (2FA) is effective for secure authentication, it can cause critical security issues if not well-implemented.



Attackers can figure out the four- and six-digit 2FA verification codes through SIM swap attacks if they are sent through SMS. Some two-factor authentication is also not truly two-factor; if a user is attempting to access sensitive information on a stolen phone using cached credentials, a "second factor" that sends a message to that same phone adds no additional security.



### 6. Human Negligence



Human error can result in serious authentication vulnerabilities that are far easier to take advantage of than brute-force attacks, SQL injections, and authentication bypasses. This negligence includes actions such as:



\- Leaving a computer on and unlocked in a public place  

\- Losing devices to theft  

\- Leaking sensitive information to strangers  

\- Writing bad code



## How to Prevent Authentication Vulnerabilities?



While authentication vulnerabilities are easy to identify, they greatly impact cybersecurity. But, you can prevent them from happening.



Here are eight best practices to prevent authentication-based vulnerabilities and keep critical information safe:



- **1. Implement a reliable brute-force protection system:** Brute-force attacks can be prevented by enforcing account lockouts, rate limiting  

- **2. Enforce a secure password policy:** Create a password checker that tells users how strong their passwords are in real-time 

- **3. Modify cookie headers:** Use `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` tags when setting cookies to protect against XSS and CSRF  

- **4. Check your verification code logic carefully:** Audit all permission checks in your code to prevent privilege escalation  

- **5. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication Correctly:** Ensure 2FA codes are secure, random, and can't be reused or bypassed 



## Conclusion



Authentication vulnerabilities — whether related to website or application security or infrastructure access — are critical cybersecurity issues you can identify and prevent.
