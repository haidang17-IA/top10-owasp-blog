# OWASP Top 10 Blog Collection

This repository hosts a personal blog documenting my journey in learning and practicing web application security, based on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

The blog is powered by **Jekyll** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

##  Blog Overview

Each post focuses on a specific OWASP vulnerability category and includes:

- Real-world examples and explanations
- Hands-on labs (mostly using PortSwigger Academy and DVWA)

- Remediation tips

The blog is structured as a learning log with weekly posts:

- **Injection**
- **Broken Authentication**
